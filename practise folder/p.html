    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <p>
      This project is a simple and responsive website created using HTML.<br />
      The main goal of this project is to practice web development skills and
      understand how to structure a clean and organized webpage. <br />It
      includes different sections such as Home, About, project. Through this
      project, I improved my ability to design layouts, style navigation bars,
      and create user-friendly pages.
